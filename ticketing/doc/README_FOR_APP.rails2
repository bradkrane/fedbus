= FedBus Ticketing

This application constitutes the server component of the new FedBus application
being developed at http://develop.feds.ca/projects/fedbus to replace the previous
site at https://fedbus.feds.ca.

It is responsible for managing and displaying the bus schedule, allowing students
to book passage on a bus, and then subsequently retrieving this information in a
form suitable for use by the boarding (client) component.
